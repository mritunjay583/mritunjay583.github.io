For example, the expat XML parser (written in C) has been found vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. Even if you use a secure parser (or run it in a sandbox), things that can go wrong.\\ \\ Various attacks rely on the attacker's ability to specify XML entities. Entities are \"codes\" (such as &quot; ) that are translated into defined strings by the parser. HTML has a predefined set of entities, but in XML, entities can be specified arbitrarily. An entity specification usually looks like this:\\ \\ <!ENTITY ent \"Hello!\"> \\ \\ With this definition, whenever the parser comes across &ent; , it will replace it with Hello! . Entities are usually defined in the document type, which can be provided in a separate file or in the <!DOCTYPE> section at the beginning of an XML document.Entities are used in a variety of XML-related attacks. For example, they can be used for something called the billion laughs attack , where an entity resolves to other entities, which resolve to other entities, etc., causing high memory usage and essentially resulting in a denial-of-service attack.\\ \\ Even more serious is an attack using external entities . Definitions of external entities look similar to regular entity definitions, but they reference local files or URLs. Unless the XML parser has been specifically instructed not to expand external entities, a definition like <!ENTITY etc SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\"> would include the /etc/passwd file where the entity &etc; occurs in the XML document, leading to the disclosure of files as well as internal URLs.It's very important to restrict entity specification in user-provided or untrusted XML.

Here are a few issues that can occur:\\ \\ * Path traversal: The names of uploaded files must be carefully sanitized to prevent attackers from uploading files with paths in the name, such as ../../../../some_existing_file.html . Files like these can end up in the wrong directory. * Null bytes: The names of uploaded files must be examined for null bytes, which can cause file names to be truncated (e.g., a file called evilfile.exe[0x00].gif might become evilfile.exe when stored on disk). * Interpretation: Files on the file system are much more likely to end up being interpreted. For example, if an attacker manages to store an uploaded file somewhere underneath the web root and names it evilfile.php , it might be executed as PHP code by the web server. \\ To prevent issues like these, store user-uploaded content in a database instead. If your application stores files on the file system, be sure to implement careful handling, validation, and sanitization of uploaded files. {{%/notice%}} {{ }} In most cases, file type restrictions should be in place for uploads. What types of files does your application white-list? {{ }} How does the application enforce these file type restrictions? {{ }} * (extension) We verify the file type by checking the file extension on the server side. * (contenttype) We look at the content type that is sent by the user. * (reencoding) We decode and re-encode the file, storing only the result. * (other) We employ another method to verify the file type. {{ }} {{ {webvuln_upload_storage} == 'other' >}} Explain how you verify the file type and enforce the whitelist: {{ }} {{ }} {{ {webvuln_upload_storage_type} has 'extension' and {webvuln_upload_storage} == 'fs' >}} {{%notice warning%}} Warning \u2014 possible medium-risk issue \\ \\ Some web servers are configured by default to allow double file extensions. For example, if a user uploads a file called malicious.php.gif , it might actually be executed as PHP code upon retrieval. Because you store uploaded files on the file system, this issue may affect your application. Make sure your web server uses only the last extension (i.e., the part after the right-most dot in the file name) when determining how to process the file.\\ {{%/notice%}} {{ }} {{ {webvuln_upload_storage_type} has 'reencoding' >}} {{%notice warning%}} Warning \u2014 possible medium-risk issue \\ \\ Re-encoding files uploaded by users is usually a very good approach. However, note that because the decoding and re-encoding works on untrusted user input (and because parsing is difficult and error-prone), it's best to perform these operations in a sandbox. That way, even if an attacker successfully exploits a vulnerability in the parser, the effects would be constrained to the sandboxed environment. Various sandboxing APIs are available, such as the Seccomp library for Linux.\\ You could also run the decoder/encoder on an isolated virtual machine that's regularly reset to a predefined state. Note, however, that a successful attacker would still be able to observe all incoming and outgoing files, unless the reset happens after each individual file operation\\ Even with a sandboxed encoder, some attacker-provided content may survive the re-encoding. For example, in images, the EXIF metadata may be left intact. If this occurs and the content type is incorrectly set (or browser content-sniffing behavior kicks in), cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can result.\\ \\ Describe the steps you're taking to protect against vulnerabilities in the decoding and parsing code: {{ }} {{%/notice%}} {{ }} {{ {webvuln_upload_storage_type} has 'contenttype' and !({webvuln_upload_storage_type} has 'reencoding') and !({webvuln_upload_storage_type} has 'extension') >}} {{%notice danger%}} Warning \u2014 possible high-risk issue \\ \\ Unfortunately, verifying the content type of uploaded files is generally not sufficient for enforcing a whitelist. Because the content type is a field in the HTTP request sent by the user, it can be arbitrarily set by an attacker (for example, by using an interception proxy). At a minimum, the application should also verify the extension at the very end of the file name and check it against the whitelist.\\ \\ If you have compensating controls in place or feel that this issue does not constitute a risk in your specific circumstances, please explain below.

When this occurs, an attacker may be able to read or even write data directly from or to the database. {{ }} * (orm) Our application uses an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework. When we need to manually construct queries or conditions, we use one of the mechanisms selected below: * (prepared) We use prepared statements and let the framework take care of correctly escaping the user input. * (stored) We pass user input to the database via stored procedures. * (manual) We manually escape user input whenever we need to use it in a database query. * (other) We do something else. {{ }} {{ {webvuln_db_sql} has 'other' >}} Describe the other mechanism you're using to protect against SQL injection: {{ }} {{ }} {{ {webvuln_db_sql} has 'orm' >}} {{%notice%}} Tip \\ \\ Using an ORM layer is generally a good way to protect against SQL injection. However, in most ORM frameworks, it's possible to directly specify parts of the SQL query. Some ORM frameworks also have a special querying language that makes it possible to set the WHERE part of the statement. In these cases, you still need to be sure to guard against injection vulnerabilities. {{%/notice%}} {{ }} {{ {webvuln_db_sql} has 'orm' >}} What ORM framework are you using ? {{ }} {{ }} {{ {webvuln_db_sql} has 'stored' >}} {{%notice%}} Tip \\ \\ Using stored procedures is generally a good way to protect against SQL injection. But this strategy must be used consistently. Make sure neither the stored procedures themselves nor the calls of the stored procedures are vulnerable to injection attacks. {{%/notice%}} {{ }} {{ {webvuln_db_sql} has 'prepared' && !({webvuln_db_sql} has 'manual') >}} Do you take special steps (policies, code reviews, audits, etc.) to ensure that prepared statements are used consistently, and that string concatenation is never used to construct database queries? {{ }} * (yes) Yes, we have all or most of these measures in place, and we're very confident that there are no SQL injection vulnerabilities in our code. * (no) We try to make our developers use prepared statements, but it may be possible for some string concatenation to slip through. {{ }} {{ }} {{ {webvuln_db_sql} has 'manual' or {webvuln_db_sql_prepared} == 'no' >}} {{%notice warning%}} Warning \u2014 possible medium-risk issue \\ \\ Manually escaping SQL (or related) queries is error-prone and very difficult to do consistently. Here are a couple of examples:\\ * PHP provides the function mysql_escape_string for escaping user input that will be used in a database query. Unfortunately, that function does not take into account the character set of the connection, so it may still be possible to smuggle in user input that will be interpreted as part of the SQL query. Applications should use mysql_real_escape_string instead. * In SQL, numbers do not need to be surrounded with quotation marks when used in a statement. For example, SELECT username WHERE id=123 is perfectly valid. But if user-provided input that will be used as a number is not confirmed to be actually numeric, the resulting code will be vulnerable to SQL injection (even if the input is escaped). We highly recommend using something like prepared statements, or using an ORM layer consistently throughout the application. Make sure you have procedures in place to enforce your approach (such as static tests when code is checked into the repository).\\ \\ If you have compensating controls in place or feel that this issue does not constitute a risk in your specific circumstances, please explain below.

Here are some examples: Simple unit tests : Unit tests are typically used to confirm that the basic building blocks of the application work as expected. Unit tests are easy to repeat \u2014 they can run whenever new code is checked into the repository, to confirm that the code still behaves as expected. Unit tests can also check for security features. For example, they can be used to confirm that requests fail without XSRF tokens; that authentication is required to access user data; or that unexpected HTML tags can't get through input filters or escaping routines. Release testing : Before a new version of a product is released, human testers typically go through the application, try the new features, and make sure previous features still work correctly (regression testing). Security testing should be included in this process as well. For example, release testing is a great time to verify that user A cannot access the data of user B. Monitoring : Once the application is deployed, the focus usually shifts from testing to monitoring. Watch out for unexpected spikes in error rates, sandbox violations, and other flaky or inexplicable behavior (including intermittent test failures) \u2014 and before you dismiss an anomaly, check with your security team.
